I am a CLMS student at the University of Washington (UW) advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). I am broadly interested in computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP). At [Noah's ARK](http://www.ark.cs.washington.edu/), I work with [Maarten Sap](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~msap/index.html) and [Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/) on social NLP problems; [Nikolaos Pappas](https://nik0spapp.github.io/) on document-level language understanding. Besides, I also work with [Shane Steinert-Threlkeld](https://www.shane.st/) on interpretability of NLP models and emergent communication.

I got my bachelor degree in Statistics at Nanjing University (NJU), where I did research in NLP with [Shujian Huang](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj/). Previously, I interned at Singapore University of Technology and Design and Westlake University working with [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/). I spent a wonderful junior year at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), where I made up my mind researching language technologies.
