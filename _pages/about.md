I am a CLMS student at the University of Washington (UW) advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). I broadly interested in computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP). Specifically, I work with [Nikolaos Pappas](https://nik0spapp.github.io/) on document-level language understanding and [Maarten Sap](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~msap/index.html) on endowing NLP systems with social intelligence. 

I got my bachelor degree in Statistics at Nanjing University (NJU), where I did research in NLP with [Shujian Huang](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj/). Previously, I interned at Singapore University of Technology and Design and Westlake University, worked with [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/). I spent a wonderful junior year at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), where I made up my mind researching language technologies.
